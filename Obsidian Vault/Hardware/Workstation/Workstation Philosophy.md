## Abstract
This document discusses my main development [[Workstation Setup]] and the rationale for the [[Workstation Hardware Config]] it uses. It also touches on the operating system(s) I choose to use to get my work done as well.
### Use Cases

The machine known as Pantheon is a purpose-built workstation with personal and professional requirements needed by myself. I use [[Linux]]/[[FreeBSD]] for code development, data science (machine/deep learning), video and image editing, technical writing and day to day life tasks like browsing the web and paying the bills. So if I list that out in no specific priorities in mind:

|     | Capabilities Required         |                                         |
| --- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Technical Writing             | Markdown and LateX                      |
| 2   | Image Editing                 |                                         |
| 3   | Video Editing                 |                                         |
| 4   | Code Development              | NeoVIM, VSCode                          |
| 5   | Virtualization                | Virt Manager, Bhyve                     |
| 6   | Sizeable software repositores | Native packages over containers for now |
| 7   | Currency                      | Not ancient compilers GCC CLang         |
| 8   | Customization                 | i3, DWM, BSPWM, Hyprland                |
