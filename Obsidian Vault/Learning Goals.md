# Abstract
## Learning Goals

**WHY** am I doing this?
I think I am done with Risk Management. I have other skills in machine learning and IT in general and want to be more than a guy who runs experiments for def ears to fall on...

### Learning Plan Prioritization
Based upon my research ([[Career and Education Planning]]), I think it prudent that the list be less IT focused and more introduction to Biology, botany, atmospheric and agricultural sciences relevant.

**So:**
1) [AWS Certified Cloud Practioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1)
2) [AWS Certified Data Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1)
3) [AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) 
4) [Linux+](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/)
5) [AWS Certified Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) (Associate Level)
6) [Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)

Then the rest in whatever order....
