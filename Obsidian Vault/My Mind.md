# Abstract
This is my brain's index. A Rolodex of the shit happening up top. A Dewey decimal system for things long forgotten....

Major Pathways only as each will branch off into many smaller subjects and notes from there.

This note should open automatically as my homepage going forward. It will keep me grounded on all my thoughts and notes linked to those thoughts so I don't go down a rabbit hole and get lost. Like I normally do
## Major Mental Pathways:
- [[Career and Education Planning]]
- [[Finance]]
- [[Family Plan]]
- [[Linux]]
