# Abstract
I need to make a change. Nationwide is dead to me.
They just moved me under Cory, I hate my life. He's an idiot and I refuse to take any orders from him.
## Here is my plan
Go somewhere that actually helps the world and can use my IT and AI skills.
Places such as:
- Marine Life Sciences
- Agricultural Sciences
- Electrical Engineering in the solar power generation industry
### Let's get certified!
Already outlined this in my [[2024 Learning Goals]]
I only need 3 to shore up my resume.
### Let's update that resume!
I have found my latest version and plan to rebuild it with my latest works.
#### Portfolio Materials
I need to steal my work shit and add it to my git repo....
Side load it out the door via Azure Blob
### Update that LinkedIn Profile
It's so crusty...
### Social Media Cleanup
Just maybe Facebook needs updating and more family focused.
### Personal Website
Will need to construct from scratch. Maybe copy this guys template. It's fancy https://hugocisneros.com/resume/
### Publicly available GitLab
Repo cleanup time!
