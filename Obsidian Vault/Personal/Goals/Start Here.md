Subject: Making My Own Life Better
---
--------------------------------
## Career and Education Planning
I need to make a change. Nationwide is dead to me.
They just moved me under Cory, I hate my life. He's an idiot and I refuse to take any orders from him.

## Here is my plan
Go somewhere that actually helps the world and can use my IT and AI skills.
Places such as:
- Marine Life Sciences
- Agricultural Sciences
- Electrical Engineering in the solar power generation industry
### Let's get certified!
Already outlined this in my [[2024 Learning Goals]]
I only need 3 to shore up my resume.
### Let's update that resume!
I have found my latest version and plan to rebuild it with my latest works.
#### Portfolio Materials
I need to steal my work shit and add it to my git repo....
Side load it out the door via Azure Blob
### Update that LinkedIn Profile
It's so crusty...
### Social Media Cleanup
Just maybe Facebook needs updating and more family focused.
### Personal Website
Will need to construct from scratch. Maybe copy this guys template. It's fancy https://hugocisneros.com/resume/
### Publicly available GitLab
Repo cleanup time!

-------------------
## Living Situation for the Family
I also want to get my current house ready for sale so my family and I can relocate to a warmer place. Ohio is the weather devil. I also want a place my children can grow up and have many opportunities to just live life, not work until they are dead like I have and my family before me.

### Current Milestones
- Finish back patio
	- Hardscaping
- Front yard landscaping refresh
	- Rip out the bushes (Call Allscape)
	- Bring in dirt and mulch
	- Replace with new plants/bushes (TBD)
	- Add flowers for the wife
- Finish electrical that I ripped out in the basement
- Replace water heater with new one (Service Experts)
