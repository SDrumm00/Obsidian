# Abstract

It is a pain in my ass to get this prescription so I have documented below each phone as my customer journey over time. 

## Process
Based off my conversation today (20230123)

Steps to produced each time I need to refill my prescription are as follows:
1) Initiate Optum phone call  @1-855-427-4682 - available 24/7 - skip the automated messenger and go to the member advocate
	1) My Janssen payment card starts out with a zero dollar balance
	2) Optum then triggers a withdraw of $25 from my Janssen Virtual Payment Card
3) Wait 30-40 minutes for my insurance to populate the Janssen payment card with the actual disbursement ($3830 was the amount on this same date)
	1) Don't let Optum try and reverse the debit or retry to debit the card multiple times.... it screws things up bad and 3 calls becomes 6+
4) Check the Janssen card [online](https://www.janssencard.com/) to see if the money has populated or not. 
	1) My 11 digit Member ID Number is  72664691010 and it asks for my DOB
	2) If the money is not present at this time, call them back @ 866-708-8987, Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM-8:00 PM ET
	3) If it did, call Optum back @1-855-427-4682 - available 24/7 and have Optum complete order and deliver medication
5) Name of drugs Tremfya 100mg/5ml

## Call History
**20231030** - Jessica took my calls
- She placed the order and noticed that copay card had no balance and was declined. I mentioned to her that it will be and that her order triggered Janssen to auto-load the copay card but only after 45 minutes or so. She will try again in about an hour and if she is successful, I will hear nothing. If she fails to procure the balance of the order ($290), she will contact me before proceeding. I did not authorize her to use my Visa for the $295 balance. It should always be $290 goes to the copay card and $5 goes to my Visa
**20240414** - call with Tiana
- Had Tiana attempt to charge to the virtual payment card, it failed. She made a note that it failed and added that I will call back in about 30 minutes and try again, it will likely be a different care representative at that time. The note Tiana made will be available to the next person to complete the process.
- 30 minutes later, I checked by balance at https://www.janssencard.com/view-your-account and found the balance on the card has been populated for the amount that Tiana charged. Calling back to complete transaction.
- Call with Roy, refill my prescription call
