I work for Cory Cisler now. I hate my life and am leaving this fucking shit company.

I meet with him today about my role on his team.

Spoke to James White, he is happy he is gone and working for Dustin in the CSOC now.

Cory asked for my strengths finder


In the end, he had no clue what to do and is currently running around asking people for advice.
He said in 30 days he'll know something and in 90 days I'll be up and running.

I have no intent on staying and if I read between the lines, he is giving me 90 days to leave before he shoves shit work down my throat making me regret staying.
