# About
https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox

Use any linux distribution inside your terminal. Enable both backward and forward compatibility with software and freedom to use whatever distribution youâ€™re more comfortable with.

On Debian, I plan to use Podman as it fits nicely with the Podman AI labs I wish to use for local LLM's.
 See https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/ for reviews on best local LLM's outside of the Podman solution.
 

## Getting started
Installation on Debian 12 is easy with 
`apt install distrobox`

By default, it will install podman as a dependency so easy peezy.
At the time of installation, the version installed was:
```
distrobox version
distrobox: 1.4.2.1
```

### Install Lutris on an image of Arch
1) `distrobox create --name Lutris --image fedora:latest`
2) `distrobox enter Lutris`

Once inside the pod named Lutris, simply install Lutris
`sudo pacman -S Lutris`

It will install the necessary things. Now to test it by running the command
`lutris`

Error messages:

- requires a distrobox restart

Fluidsynth
`pacman -S fluidsynth`

canberra-gtk-module error
