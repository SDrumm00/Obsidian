Yesterday I had my first day with my new employer [[Whitecap]]. My boss and I had a call and he is cool. I think he is younger than I but he is in a great place to grow his team and he said he has plans for me to help him do that which is exciting. I never had a sense of worth at [[Nationwide]] so that made me feel good even though it seemed like the work he had for me was going to be a lot and going to start as early as next week.

I am hopeful that this was a good move. 

As I listen to my children play on that god damned electronic keyboard downstairs.. I just tell myself, this is a good thing and I am going to learn a lot and move the needle for a company that WANTS my help.

Ironically, I am shipping my Nationwide laptop back to the company via FedEx today and good riddance. I look at my desk in front of me a giant mess of USB cables hooking everything up to my new laptop... Why can't I get my Bluetooth to work on this thing? Ugh, some things never change.

Today's outlook is focusing on capturing notes, meeting with HR and the OPP360 team which is the application I will be inheriting in the next 8 weeks. It is mostly a Flask app with an ML back-end I have no knowledge about. I figure I will have for an SBOM and documentation.

I think that's it! I am smiling and things are quiet for now so I will soak it in while I can.
