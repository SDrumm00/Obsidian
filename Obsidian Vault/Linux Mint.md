## Abstract
So I am testing a new Linux distro.. again. This time it is Linux Mint based on top of Ubuntu.

### Why?
Because it meets all my requirements that I have listed in my [[Workstation Philosophy]] document while also just being pretty stable/reliable and works with ZFS easily. I also noticed it games, which, is a low priority to my larger goals but still desired as I need to find some relaxation time for me too!

I am testing out the other capabilities like media, [[Machine Learning]] and analytic toolkits, container toolkits (using PodMan right now). To be determined how well they work but so far, it's like using Ubuntu but without the Snaps. They use Flatpaks instead. I noticed when using Ubuntu that the Snaps simply didn't work well and were slow compared to the Flatpaks.

I get Root on ZFS as well which is a big bonus! I can now study ZFS Boot Environments and the same image build pipelines that both Debian and Ubuntu use to create their ISO's with native Root on ZFS going forward.

I think this variant of Linux has a bright future for people like me who need to use their machine to get work done and not tinker all day. Even though I can tinker if I want too!

### More to come
