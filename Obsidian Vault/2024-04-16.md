Learned how to get Flatpaks to appear in [[DMenu]] today... its only 330 am too

To run a flatpak app from dmenu, you can create a symlink for the app in `/usr/bin`. You can find the flatpak apps binary link in `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/` on ubuntu. E.g. to run Rocket Chat (installed from flatpak via software center), you can do something like this:

```
sudo ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/chat.rocket.RocketChat /usr/bin/rocket-chat
```

can't sleep, too many terrible thoughts about work. I literally woke up thinking about James being a Sr. Consultant today. I like James but he is only 1 year into NW and and my 10 means nothing, I can't stand to watch that happen to me, i need to move on


## Paths to Reproducible DL

## - Distrobox Debian (same as host)
same as host due to cuda libraries and apt sources lists

then install the tiny little jupyterhub
- https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/


This is not an option as the docker containers do not come with systemd which is required by TLJH
## - Nvidia Container Runtime
Installation
https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/
https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#debian

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions
After the compile completes, run the 2 tests below, they should both state PASS
- `./deviceQuery`
- `./bandwidthTest`

https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/1.14.5/sample-workload.html

Seems my life sucks right now... the CUDA tests passed just fine but when I launch a GPU accerelated container with CUDA like PyTorch, it simply is not showing up...

I wonder where I messed up?

I feel I am close
## - Install on localhost
last and least desired option but will take it in lieu of nothing else
- https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/custom-server.html

Failed to spawn a hub node. Found an interesting link for troubleshooting.
- can't find it anymore but basically, it was stating that the version of Node and NPM that ships with Debian and Ubuntu is pretty old and to update it from the website
	- did that, it still failed

Going to try one last thing
