# Abstract
## Current Living Situation for the Family
I also want to get my current house ready for sale so my family and I can relocate to a warmer place. Ohio is the weather devil. I also want a place my children can grow up and have many opportunities to just live life, not work until they are dead like I have and my family before me.
### Current Milestones
- ~~Finish back patio~~
	- ~~Hardscaping~~
- Front yard landscaping refresh
	- ~~Rip out the bushes (Call Allscape)~~
	- ~~Bring in dirt and mulch~~
	- ~~Replace with new plants/bushes (TBD)~~
	- Add flowers for the wife
- Finish electrical that I ripped out in the basement
- Replace water heater with new one (Service Experts)

## Future Living Situation for the Family
I want to relocate to warmer climates. My wife wants North Carolina so we are taking a vacation there with the kids to look into it directly.

What I want is beachfront in tropical climates. It could be Hawaii, the Caribbean the Outer Banks. It doesn't matter so long as I shrug these seasonal depression issues soon.

### Top Destinations
1) North Carolina
2) South Carolina
3) Hawaii
4) U.S. Virgin Islands - St. Croix
