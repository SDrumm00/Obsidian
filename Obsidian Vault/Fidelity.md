# Abstract
It's time to look at all of my retirement funds from all my previous employers and begin to consolidate them down and re-invest them into my own diversified portfolio.

I also need a good tool to consolidate all these accounts down into a dashboard somehow.

I was once working with [[Personal Capital]]. Not sure if it's still any good.
