How to use addons to push my notes to a git repo like my local git repo.

Found a great YouTube video [Linking Your Thinking Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA)

Also has a website [Linking Your Thinking Website](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) website worth reading in my free time although the price is out of my reach.

How to tag a note is by using the `#` sign like below.
