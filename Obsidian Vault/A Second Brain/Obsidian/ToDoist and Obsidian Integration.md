This integration allows me to use [[A Second Brain/Obsidian/Learn Obsidian]] only while at my workstation and organize my larger notes and ToDo's

Integratiing [[Todoist]] into my Obsidian workflow so I can see and organize the "storage" of items and turn them into a "factory" of actions.

Where did I learn that from? Youtube [[Personal/Goals/2024/Zettelkasten/Tiago Forte]] and [[A Second Brain]]
