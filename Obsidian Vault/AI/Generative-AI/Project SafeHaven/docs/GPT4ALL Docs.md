# GPT4ALL

#Generative-AI #OpenAI #ChatGPT #LLM #Linux

I set up a locally running variant that works on my machine without an NVidia GPU.

Here is information I need to write down about it:
1) https://docs.gpt4all.io/index.html
2) https://gpt4all.io/index.html

Here is additional information from running this thing on a Linux host ([[Debian]]):
1) https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-gpt4all-on-ubuntu-debian-linux


Make note:
- The command to execute the binary that is installed is
```
$ ~/gpt4all/bin/chat
```
