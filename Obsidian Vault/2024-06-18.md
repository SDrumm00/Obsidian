Today I ordered new Internet provider. I had issues again last night with my Time Warner/ Spectrum service just dropping me in the middle of a game. I hate that. It happens too often for my work as well. I need reliable always on Internet. So, I chose to test a local rival named Omni Fiber. They are month to month no contract, faster and cheaper. Let's hope.

I also began thinking hard about my [[Retirement]] investments and 401k. I switched to a Roth IRA Retirement option. I need to watch my [[Investments]] and begin to get better at that.
