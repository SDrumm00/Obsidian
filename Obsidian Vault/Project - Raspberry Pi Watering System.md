## Abstract
I want to water my plants in an automated fashion.

Here is some extra reading material.
- https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/

The things I wish to do:
- Monitor the soil moisture levels
- Trigger an event that pumps water into the plant
- Hook a camera up to the system to monitor images over time creating a time-lapse video
- Ultimately get into the plant specific chemistry and monitor the chemistry in the water as well but that is later.

Right now, I am trying to figure out how to get started.

I need a monitor

I need a pump
I need tubing
I need wiring
I need a breadboard

I could just buy from this list:
- https://www.instructables.com/Soil-Moisture-Sensor-Raspberry-Pi/

I should check my Arduino kit for some of this.
