[[ARP 1]] (stands for Address Resolution Protocol) is a tool that has the following description in the man pages.

DESCRIPTION
ARP manipulates or displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbor cache. It can add entries to the table, delete one or display the current content.

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the media access control address of a network neighbor for a given IPv4 Address.

I mainly use it to get the [[MAC addresses]] for each [[IP address]] on my networks.
