# Abstract
What can I say here that we all don't already know? Linux is amazing! I use it as my daily driver for my desktop usage as well as my server usage in my rack in the basement. I was distro-hopping for years. Settling on .deb based family of OS's in my head. I do like .rpm based family as well though and it is more common in enterprise scenarios.
  
I also like LTS model of updates. It makes the system feel more reliable and more like I can trust it to be there just the way I left it, even if that was several days ago.
## Linux Operating Systems:
### Preferred Operating Systems
  1) Debian still the grandaddy of them all and still the universal operating system that just works
  2) Fedora
  3) Redhat for the commercial support? No... for the security model! Best in breed
  4) Ubuntu for the same reasons as above
  5) NixOS which is a beast all in it's own and requires it's own set of notes... BUT I LOVE IT!
### Features
  1) [[Immutability]]
  2) [[ZFS Filesystem]]
  3) [[GPU based Deep Learning]]/[[Machine Learning]] on NVidia and CUDA
