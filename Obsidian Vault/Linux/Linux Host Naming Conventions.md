You know what? I think I settled on a naming convention for my hosts across my damn network today.....


I am a big fan Greek mythology and the 12 Olympians dystopian world views.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians

I think the names I will settle on for now are.
My primary workstation is known as Pantheon as it is the group of Gods that constituted the Greek pantheon and I see similarities in how I manage all servers from my workstation.

Next names for servers will be:
Olympic Gods
1) Zeus
2) Poseidon
3) Hera
4) Demeter
5) Hestia

Zeus Offspring:
1) Aphrodites
2) Athena
3) Artemis
4) Apollo
5) Ares
6) Hephaestus
7) Hermes
8) Dionysus

Primordial Deities
1) Uranus
2) Gaia

Titans:
1) Cronus
2) Rhea

"The Olympians were a race of [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity"), primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(religion) "Pantheon (religion)") and so named because of their residency atop [Mount Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus "Mount Olympus"). They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long [war of gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy "Titanomachy"), in which [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus") led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling immortal beings, the [Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(mythology) "Titan (mythology)"), children of the [primordial deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_primordial_deities "Greek primordial deities") [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology) "Uranus (mythology)") and [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia "Gaia").
