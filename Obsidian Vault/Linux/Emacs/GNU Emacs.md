# Emacs, why Emacs?

## First, what IS Emacs?
Here is a quote from the [GNU Emacs website](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

" An extensible, customizable, [free/libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) text editor â€” and more.
At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing."

So what is the point of this tool in common English?
1) It's an IDE for my development workloads.
2) It's a note taking system thanks to an add-on known as [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/).
	1) In addition to [[Org Mode]] for simple note taking, there is a further extension of that add-on known as [Org-Roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)].
	2) The addition of [[Org-roam]] takes this IDE with note taking capabilities and turns it into what I like to call a [[A Second Brain]].

Ideally, having a second brain, along with the ability to create quick "to Do's" using [[Todoist]] would make for an idea factory! Using the [[Zettelkasten]] technique while learning about [[Personal/Goals/2024/Zettelkasten/Tiago Forte]] and his methods for build a second brain will help me as I get old and become and old fuss bucket for not being able to remember anything.

## Getting Started
How does a new user such as myself get started on this journey?

### Installing
Check out the [[Emacs Installation]] instructions for how to get the software installed locally.

### Adding Functionality
I want to go from the horrible 30 year old looking interface to a cooler, darker theme and want to use keybinds that don't hurt me....

Try [[Doom Emacs]] out.

### Future Exploration Topics
The list of things not yet learned but will be addressed are kept in the [[Emacs Exploration Topics]] note.
