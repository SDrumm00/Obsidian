Is this my forever [[Linux 1]] home? Will I stop distro-hopping? 

## Why I like it
So what is it about Debian that I like so much?
Well, the other day, I just got it to work for every possible use case I have for a Linux distribution.

1) [[Machine Learning]] (specifically Anaconda software)
2) [[Gaming on Linux]] (eg, Lutris and Steam and with good performance!)
3) [[Technical Writing LaTeX]] (LATeX)
4) Programming
5) Video Editing ([[DaVinci Resolve]]), Photo Editing and Audio Editing
6) Typical Uses like Office work, safe web browsing, music

It's an everything bagel for Linux!

## Why others like it
Not just things that I solely love about it but they also have their reasons why it is such a great distro...
[Why Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian)

Plus, I am OCD in that I like my distro to be "stable" or rather, I like it to be in the state that I left it in even if that was a month ago. Not a rolling distro, not having to deal with constant updates and updates that break.

Now, I know that I had to add repos and make some tweaks to the OS which I hope do not add instability, but only time will tell and so far, this is the longest time I have had a distro in a while that has made me feel so good.

### More reasons!
#### [The Debian Philosophy](https://www.debian.org/intro/philosophy)
#### [Debian Security](https://www.debian.org/security/) 
is top notch. This is a real reason to stay with the platform as they have many features of safety and defense in depth that appeal to me. Also, this only applies to the vanilla (stable) version of Debian and not the testing and unstable branches. Which is fine by me as well! I have subscribed to their mailing list to be made aware of the latest CVE's and vulnerabilities that can be patch with an update.
#### The Debian Constitution
Debian is owned by a community of people from all over the world all with equal rights to the project. This is known as their democratic governance structure managed by the [Debian Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution)This means that a corporation cannot take control of the project and make decisions that are in the company's' interest over the folks who contribute to it (like Redhat and Ubuntu) which are more driven by large corporations. Not that they don't add value to the ecosystem, they get paid to develop upstream as well which is good for Debian too. 
#### [Debian User Support](https://www.debian.org/support)
There are so many ways to get support!
1) The forums are my favorite
2) IRC is a lesser known and I don't really use it myself way to get real time support
3) Mailing Lists and UseNet Groups
4) The very best [Bug Tracker](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/) ever!

#### Debian Documentation
There is a manual!
