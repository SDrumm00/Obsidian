MX Linux is my latest and so far most favorite Linus Desktop OS. I mean that when I say **DESKTOP** OS as the other variants are either too rough around the edges or too close to the bleeding edge for my comfort.

This one is based on Debian stable and therefore is slower and more reliable as it is exactly the way I left it, every time.

More to come
