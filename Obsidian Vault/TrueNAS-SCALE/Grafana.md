Starting point for learning Grafana for several use cases.
1) Home monitoring of my devices and logs [[Grafana at Home]]
2) Adding things like weather, crime reports, other analytic use cases to the dashboard for home use
3) Possibly a work related use case and adding a SIF for integrating it into Databricks and beyond?

# Dashboard anything. Observe everything.

Query, visualize, alert on, and understand your data no matter where it’s stored. With Grafana you can create, explore, and share all of your data through beautiful, flexible dashboards.

## Why Grafana?

### Unify your data, not your database

Grafana doesn’t require you to ingest data to a backend store or vendor database. Instead, Grafana takes a unique approach to providing a “single-pane-of-glass” by unifying your existing data, wherever it lives.

With Grafana, you can take any of your existing data- be it from your Kubernetes cluster, raspberry pi, different cloud services, or even Google Sheets- and visualize it however you want, all from a single dashboard.

_Come together… right now… over me (sing it)._

### Data everyone can see

Grafana was built on the principle that data should be accessible to everyone in your organization, not just the single Ops person.

By democratizing data, Grafana helps to facilitate a culture where data can easily be used and accessed by the people that need it, helping to break down data silos and empower teams.

_Of course, sometimes you don’t want Eric in Accounting to see everything, Grafana Cloud and Enterprise editions offer extensive security options._

### Dashboards that anyone can use

Not only do Grafana dashboards give insightful meaning to data collected from numerous sources, but you can also share the dashboards you create with other team members, allowing you to explore the data together.

With Grafana, anyone can create and share dynamic dashboards to foster collaboration and transparency.

_We don’t really mean anyone, especially that guy that talks about how much better it was when we had fax machines._

### Flexibility and versatility

Translate and transform any of your data into flexible and versatile dashboards. Unlike other tools, Grafana allows you to build dashboards specifically for you and your team.

With advanced querying and transformation capabilities, you can customize your panels to create visualizations that are actually helpful for you.

_We think you’re great the way you are, but who couldn’t be a bit more flexible?_
