I want to create the perfect base image for my Fedora Silverblue installation and use it as the parent image rolling forward.

Also, I would like to experiment with creating a tiling window manager version of Fedora Silverblue using Hyprland or Sway for Wayland and i3-Gaps for X11 display managers.
