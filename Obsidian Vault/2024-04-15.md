# Abstract
Reproducible Environments for Deep Learning

I want to use Debian as my main OS but am open to NixOS as well if/when possible.

Essentially, how to tear down and rebuild the development environment I require to do the job at hand. Essentially MLOps.

## Start Here
follow these instructions
- https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/custom-server.html

## Test PyTorch GPU
Steps:
pip install torch
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
torch.cuda.device_count()
torch.cuda.current_device()
torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)

Success!

Now on to the next part....
